# Autonomous Drone Installation

Script to install simple Autonomous Drone Simulation System in Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04. This ideally start after you install your ubuntu (New Ubuntu)

## Run
If you want to clone using git command
```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Balisa16/autonomous-drone-env drone-shell
cd drone-shell
```
Run Installation
```
./install.sh <option>
source ~/.bashrc
```
<i>** use ```--help```to see mandatory arguments that you can used.</i></br></br>
Find a comfortable seat and enjoy your coffee :coffee: while waiting for the installation process to finish. This process will take about 25 minutes.

## Noted
1. In the first time, when you run ``sitl`` you'll find that arducopter compile their library. It's ok and please wait until terminal show like [this](images/first_sitl.png). Compilation just occurred in the first SITL run, so it will be faster in subsequent SITL runs.
2. When installation is finished and you're run ```catkin build``` in ~/drone/ws. Your terminal should looks like [this](images/build.png)
3. I am not tested this shell for Ubuntu 18 yet. So may will be there are some error. I would like say thanks if there someone tested and give correction for Ubuntu 18 installation script.
4. ```source ~/.bashrc``` must be called after each installation.
